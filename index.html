    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The ubiquity of technologies like ChatGPT has prompted concern among school personnel and parents regarding their use in classrooms [1, 2] . Teachers worry that students will use these generative technologies for doing their assignments [2], thereby circumventing crucial learning steps. While it is not feasible to restrain students from using these tools, there is potential in providing access to them in safe environments that teachers can monitor. In order to provide that affordance for teachers we are exploring a visualization dashboard for student-AI collaboration, specifically, for writing exercises.  

Students can use AI for various writing subprocesses, like brainstorming, tone transformation, revision or even research [3]. Through our visualizations, we are interested in investigating if we can showcase the productive struggle made by students while writing with AI using salient visual encodings [4]. We are interested in showing the following metrics: 1) student-AI contribution ratio; 2) writing fluency enabled by AI; 3) engagement with ai feedback. For the purposes of our visualization, we will explore encoding channels from prior text visualization research [5,6, 7, 8] .  </p>
